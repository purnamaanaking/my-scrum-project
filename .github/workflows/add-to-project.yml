# Note: This workflow requires either:
# 1. A GitHub App with project permissions (recommended for organizations)
# 2. A Personal Access Token (PAT) with project permissions (stored in secrets.PROJECT_PAT)
#
# To use this workflow:
# 1. Create a GitHub Project at https://github.com/purnamaanaking/my-scrum-project/projects
# 2. Update the project-url above with your actual project URL
# 3. Set up authentication (GitHub App or PAT)
